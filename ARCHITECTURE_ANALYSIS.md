# Keybinding Library Architecture Analysis

This document analyzes how the Keybinding library implements SOLID and DRY principles and supports both standalone and dependency injection usage patterns.

## SOLID Principles Implementation

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Each class and interface has a single, well-defined responsibility:

- **`ICommandRegistry`** / **`CommandRegistry`**: Manages command registration and retrieval only
- **`IProfileManager`** / **`ProfileManager`**: Handles profile lifecycle management only  
- **`IKeybindingService`** / **`KeybindingService`**: Coordinates keybinding operations only
- **`IKeybindingRepository`** / **`JsonKeybindingRepository`**: Handles data persistence only
- **`KeybindingManager`**: Acts as a facade coordinating all services

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
The library is open for extension but closed for modification:

- **Repository Pattern**: New storage mechanisms can be implemented via `IKeybindingRepository` without modifying existing code
- **Service Interfaces**: All core services are interface-based, allowing custom implementations
- **Factory Pattern**: `IKeybindingManagerFactory` allows different creation strategies
- **Configuration Abstraction**: `IKeybindingConfiguration` enables different configuration sources

**Example Extension:**
```csharp
// Extend with custom repository without modifying existing code
public class DatabaseKeybindingRepository : IKeybindingRepository
{
    // Custom implementation for database storage
}

// Register with DI
services.AddKeybinding<DatabaseKeybindingRepository>();
```

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
All implementations can be substituted for their interfaces without breaking functionality:

- Any `IKeybindingRepository` implementation works with `KeybindingManager`
- Any `ICommandRegistry` implementation maintains expected behavior
- Mock implementations work seamlessly in unit tests

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Interfaces are focused and clients depend only on what they need:

- **`ICommandRegistry`**: Only command-related operations
- **`IProfileManager`**: Only profile-related operations  
- **`IKeybindingService`**: Only keybinding coordination
- **`IKeybindingRepository`**: Only persistence operations
- **`IKeybindingConfiguration`**: Only configuration properties
- **`IKeybindingManagerFactory`**: Only factory methods

No interface forces clients to depend on methods they don't use.

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concretions:

- **`KeybindingManager`** depends on interfaces (`ICommandRegistry`, `IProfileManager`, `IKeybindingRepository`)
- **`KeybindingService`** depends on abstractions (`ICommandRegistry`, `IProfileManager`)
- **Dependency Injection**: All dependencies are injected via constructor
- **Factory Pattern**: Creates objects through abstractions

## DRY Principle Implementation

### 1. Service Registration
The `ServiceCollectionExtensions` eliminates repetitive DI registration:

```csharp
// DRY: Single method registers all services
services.AddKeybinding("./data");

// Instead of repeating registration for each service
services.AddSingleton<ICommandRegistry, CommandRegistry>();
services.AddSingleton<IProfileManager, ProfileManager>();
// ... etc
```

### 2. Configuration Management
The `IKeybindingConfiguration` abstraction eliminates repeated configuration handling:

```csharp
// DRY: Configuration is centralized and reusable
var config = new KeybindingConfiguration(dataDirectory, profileId, profileName);
```

### 3. Factory Pattern
The `IKeybindingManagerFactory` eliminates duplicate creation logic:

```csharp
// DRY: Factory handles creation complexity
var manager = factory.CreateManager();
// Instead of repeating constructor calls with dependency resolution
```

### 4. Extension Methods
Service registration extensions eliminate repetitive DI setup code:

```csharp
// DRY: Multiple registration patterns available
services.AddKeybinding();                    // Default singleton
services.AddKeybindingScoped();             // Scoped services
services.AddKeybinding<CustomRepository>(); // Custom repository
```

## Standalone vs Dependency Injection Support

### Standalone Usage
The library works perfectly without any DI container:

```csharp
// Simple constructor-based instantiation
var manager = new KeybindingManager("./data");

// Or with custom services
var manager = new KeybindingManager(
    new CommandRegistry(),
    new ProfileManager(), 
    new JsonKeybindingRepository("./data"));
```

**Benefits:**
- Zero dependencies on DI frameworks
- Simple instantiation
- Full control over object lifetime
- Suitable for console apps, simple applications

### Dependency Injection Usage
Full DI support with multiple registration patterns:

```csharp
// Simple registration
services.AddKeybinding("./data");

// Custom repository
services.AddKeybinding<DatabaseRepository>();

// Scoped services (for multi-tenant scenarios)
services.AddKeybindingScoped();
```

**Benefits:**
- Automatic dependency resolution
- Configurable lifetimes (singleton, scoped, transient)
- Integration with ASP.NET Core, Generic Host
- Easy mocking for unit tests
- Configuration binding support

## Architecture Flexibility

### 1. Multiple Instantiation Patterns

**Direct Instantiation:**
```csharp
var manager = new KeybindingManager("./data");
```

**Service Locator:**
```csharp
var manager = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<KeybindingManager>();
```

**Factory Pattern:**
```csharp
var manager = factory.CreateManager("./tenant-data");
```

### 2. Configurable Dependencies

**Default Dependencies:**
```csharp
services.AddKeybinding(); // Uses JsonKeybindingRepository
```

**Custom Repository:**
```csharp
services.AddKeybinding<DatabaseKeybindingRepository>();
```

**Custom Factory:**
```csharp
services.AddKeybinding<CustomRepository>(provider => 
    new CustomRepository(provider.GetService<IOptions<DbConfig>>()));
```

### 3. Lifetime Management

**Singleton (Default):**
```csharp
services.AddKeybinding(); // All services as singletons
```

**Scoped:**
```csharp
services.AddKeybindingScoped(); // All services as scoped
```

**Mixed Lifetimes:**
```csharp
services.AddSingleton<ICommandRegistry, CommandRegistry>();
services.AddScoped<KeybindingManager>();
```

## Testing Support

The architecture enables comprehensive testing strategies:

### 1. Unit Testing with Mocks
```csharp
var mockRepository = new Mock<IKeybindingRepository>();
var mockCommands = new Mock<ICommandRegistry>();
var manager = new KeybindingManager(mockCommands.Object, mockProfiles.Object, mockRepository.Object);
```

### 2. Integration Testing
```csharp
var services = new ServiceCollection();
services.AddKeybinding();
var provider = services.BuildServiceProvider();
var manager = provider.GetRequiredService<KeybindingManager>();
```

### 3. Test-Specific Implementations
```csharp
public class InMemoryKeybindingRepository : IKeybindingRepository
{
    // In-memory implementation for testing
}

services.AddKeybinding<InMemoryKeybindingRepository>();
```

## Benefits Summary

### SOLID Compliance
✅ **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one reason to change  
✅ **Open/Closed**: Extensible without modification  
✅ **Liskov Substitution**: Implementations are truly substitutable  
✅ **Interface Segregation**: Focused, cohesive interfaces  
✅ **Dependency Inversion**: Depends on abstractions, not concretions  

### DRY Compliance
✅ **No Repeated Logic**: Common patterns are abstracted  
✅ **Reusable Components**: Services can be composed differently  
✅ **Configuration Centralization**: Settings managed in one place  
✅ **Extension Methods**: Eliminate repetitive setup code  

### Usage Flexibility
✅ **Standalone Usage**: Works without DI containers  
✅ **DI Integration**: Full support for modern DI patterns  
✅ **Multiple Lifetimes**: Singleton, scoped, transient support  
✅ **Custom Implementations**: Easy to extend and customize  
✅ **Testing Friendly**: Mockable interfaces and test implementations  

The Keybinding library successfully implements SOLID and DRY principles while providing maximum flexibility for both standalone and dependency injection usage patterns.
